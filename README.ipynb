    "The code for this step is contained in the first, second, and third code cells of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.\n",

    "`imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function. these are stored in a pickel file named `CameraMatrix_DistrotionCoefficients.pickle`. I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

    "## Pipeline overview\n",
    "\n",
    "the pipeline is defined in the fifth cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\" as the function called `advanced_pipline` in the `RobustLaneLineDetection` class. The `RobustLaneLineDetection` class contains the pipeline, lane line sanity check, and necessary definitions like the instances of the left lane, right lane, and the average of these two called lane. these are instances of the `Line` class. this class holds the memory of the last 10 successful fitted polynomial and x values of the fitted line. also, whether or not the line is detected in last try and number of the total and consecutive failed fits are stored in this class. the main use of this class is in the video process. However, the `RobustLaneLineDetection` and `Line` classes are designed so they can be used for single image as well. simply, for each new image, a new instance of the `RobustLaneLineDetection` should be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Distortion correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients obtained during the camera calibration step are passed to the constructor of the lane line detection class. these are used to undistort the image pass to the pipeline since the calibration parameters are independent from the camera angle. like before by using `cv2.undistort()` function, the undistorted image is created:\n",

    "### 2. Color and gradients transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "the goal of this stage is used to generate a thresholded binary image using the combination of color and gradient thresholds . \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Color transform and color thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Color transform is defined in the `advanced_pipeline` function in the fifth cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\". \n",
    "first, the image is converted to the HLS color space. this gives three channels: l-channel, s-channel, h-channel. the s-channel is good at detecting the differece between the light color where l-channel or gray-scale transform loses the information.  minimum 170 and maximum 255 thresholds is applied on the S-channel  and the binary output as follows: (these values are chosen so the lane lines are preserved while the other colors are canceled)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Sobel operator and gradient thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "the Sobel operator performs gradient on the l-channel to detect the edges of the objects. The Sobel operator and gradient thresholding are defined in the `abs_sobel_thresh`,`mag_thresh`, and `dir_threshold` functions in the forth cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\". these functions are calculating the sobel operator thresholding over x or y, gradient magnitude thresholding, and gradient direction thresholding respectively. Sobel operator is done by `cv2.Sobel` function which accept the gradient kernel size too. with a larger kernel size the gradient would be smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "for the purpose of lane line detection, first sobel operator is calculated over the x axis. this detects the roughly vertical edges in the image. then gradient magnitude and direction are combined, detecting the almost vertical gradients which are large enough. the result of this two operation are added and the output of the gradient thresholding is like the following image:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Combinition of the color and gradient thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "the following image illustrates how these two complete each other: where color thresholding(in blue) fails to detect the lane line gradient thresholding(in green) finds the lane and vice versa. \n",

    "The goal of this stage is to transform the \n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `unwarp()`, which appears in the [first code cell](./P2.ipynb#Helper-functions) of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\".  The `unwarp()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",
