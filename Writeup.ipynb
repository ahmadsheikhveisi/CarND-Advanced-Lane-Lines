    "install conda, and create an environment based on the yml file provided\n",

    "## Camera Calibration\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained in the first, second, and third code cells of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.\n",

    "\n",
    "`imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function. these are stored in a pickel file named `CameraMatrix_DistrotionCoefficients.pickle`. I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./output_images/CameraCalibration/Undistorted/calibration4_undistorted.jpg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "and, finally if the point to be found on the undistorted image, the image is warped using the corners as the reference points and `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform` function. the warped chessboard is as it seen from the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./output_images/CameraCalibration/Warped/calibration3_warped.jpg\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "the pipeline is defined in the fifth cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\" as the function called `advanced_pipline` in the `RobustLaneLineDetection` class. The `RobustLaneLineDetection` class contains the pipeline, lane line sanity check, and necessary definitions like the instances of the left lane, right lane, and the average of these two called lane. these are instances of the `Line` class. this class holds the memory of the last 10 successful fitted polynomial and x values of the fitted line. also, whether or not the line is detected in last try and number of the total and consecutive failed fits are stored in this class. the main use of this class is in the video process. However, the `RobustLaneLineDetection` and `Line` classes are designed so they can be used for single image as well. simply, for each new image, a new instance of the `RobustLaneLineDetection` should be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Distortion correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients obtained during the camera calibration step are passed to the constructor of the lane line detection class. these are used to undistort the image pass to the pipeline since the calibration parameters are independent from the camera angle. like before by using `cv2.undistort()` function, the undistorted image is created:\n",

    "### 2. Color and gradients transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "the goal of this stage is used to generate a thresholded binary image using the combination of color and gradient thresholds . \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Color transform and color thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "Color transform is defined in the `advanced_pipeline` function in the fifth cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./P2.ipynb\". \n",
    "first, the image is converted to the HLS color space. a minimum 170 and maximum 255 thresholds is applied on the S-channel and the binary output as follows: (these values are chosen so the lane lines are preserved while the other colors are canceled)\n",

    "#### Sobel operator and gradient thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combinition of the color and gradient thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "the following image illustrate how these two complete each other: where color thresholding(in blue) fails to detect the lane line gradient thresholding(in green) finds the lane and vice versa. \n",

    "<img src=\"./output_images/test4_stage4_clrGradThrsh.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" />\n",

    "### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:\n",

    "    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],\n",
    "    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])\n",
    "dst = np.float32(\n",
    "    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],\n",
    "    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])\n",

    "| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |\n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.\n",

    "### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:\n",
